What is the difference between == and === ?

=== is a strict equality operator, it checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result (true or false).

==  equality operator (==) checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. 
Unlike the strict equality operator, it attempts to convert and compare operands that are of different types.

The most notable difference between this operator and the strict equality (===) operator is that the strict equality operator does not attempt type conversion. 
Instead, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.
