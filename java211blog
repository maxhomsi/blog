What's the difference between an "attribute" and a "property"?

The attributes have a data type of string. So no matter the value of the attribute, it will always return a string.

Since DOM is an object in JavaScript, we can get and set properties.

What is the difference between call stack and task queue?

It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.

What is the difference between == and === ?

=== is a strict equality operator, it checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result (true or false).

==  equality operator (==) checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. 
Unlike the strict equality operator, it attempts to convert and compare operands that are of different types.

The most notable difference between this operator and the strict equality (===) operator is that the strict equality operator does not attempt type conversion. 
Instead, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.
